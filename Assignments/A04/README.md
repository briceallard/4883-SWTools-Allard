## NFL / SEQUEL Queries with MariaDB
#### Application Purpose
For this project we uploaded our previous assignments data into a mariadb database and used sql queries to find similiar answers. I had a dedicated server (HTTPS://NAAT.live/) that was used for this, and uploaded my own configuration file for connecting to the database. 

**Files:**
* index.php - The main file for queries and assignment.
* team_games.php - used to get team names when given a team id.

**Instructions:**
Simply navigate to https://NAAT.live/nfldata/ to view the query responses
